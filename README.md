1. The first filter is a bandpass chebyshev filter. The file 'F1_Chebyshev.m' generates the plots for its IIR implementation. The file 'F1_FIR.m' generates the plots for the FIR implementation.
2. The second filter is a bandstop butterworth filter. The file 'F2_Butterworth.m' generates the plots for its IIR implementation. The file 'F2_FIR.m' generates the plots for the FIR implementation.
3. Plots for the elliptic filters were generated using 'ellip' function in MATLAB.
